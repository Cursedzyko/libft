# 42_Libft

## Description
This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

## Skills

* Imperative programming
* Rigor
* Algorithms & AI

## Introduction

C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. This project allows you to re-write those functions, understand them,
and learn to use them. This library will help you with all your future C projects.
Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. But always, make sure to
check which functions are allowed !
